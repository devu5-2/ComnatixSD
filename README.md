## Assignment Title: Build a Basic Task Management System with React and SQLite Database
❖ Requirement Of The Project
1. Backend:
- Used Node.js to create a RESTful API with endpoints for:
 - Creating a new task (title, description, due date, status).
 - Viewing all tasks.
 - Updating an existing task.
 - Deleting a task.
- Tasks should be stored in an SQLite database for simplicity.
  
2. Frontend:
- Build a minimal UI using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a lightweight framework like React.
- Features should include:
 - A form to create a new task.
 - A list view to display all tasks.
 - Edit and delete buttons for each task.
 - Filters to view tasks by status (e.g., Pending, Completed).
   
3. Additional Features (Optional for Extra Credit):
- Add a status change feature with a toggle between Pending and Completed.
- Include basic error handling (e.g., validation for empty fields).
- Add a confirmation prompt before deleting a task.
